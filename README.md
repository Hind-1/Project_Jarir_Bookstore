Linear regression in statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

In my project the price is predicted by inputing features like graphics size,hard disk size, core generation etc.

The dataset is from scraping Jarir book store
